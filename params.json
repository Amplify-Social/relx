{"name":"Relcool","tagline":"Release creation for Erlang","body":"Relx assembles releases for an Erlang/OTP release. Given a release specification and a list of directories in which to search for OTP applications it will generate a release output. That output depends heavily on what plugins available and what options are defined, but usually it is simple a well configured release directory.\r\n\r\n### Example Configuration\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/tsloughter/erlangdc2013.git\r\n$ cd erlangdc2013\r\n$ cat relcool.config\r\n{release, {erlangdc, \"0.0.1\"},\r\n [estatsd\r\n ,erlangdc]}.\r\n{extended_start_script, true}.\r\n\r\n$ ./relcool\r\n...\r\n$ ls _rel/\r\nbin  erts-5.10.1  lib  log  releases\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n[relcool wiki](https://github.com/erlware/relcool/wiki)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
