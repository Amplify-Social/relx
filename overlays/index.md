Overlays
========

Overlays as defined in Rebar are directly supported in Relx. So you
can take your Overlay configuration and move it to your
`relx.config` and it should just work. For example, you could take
the following:

{% highlight erl %}
    {overlay_vars, "vars.config"}.
    {overlay, [{mkdir, "log/sasl"},
                {copy, "files/erl", "{{erts_vsn}}/bin/erl"},
                {copy, "files/nodetool", "{{erts_vsn}}/bin/nodetool"},
                {template, "files/app.config", "etc/app.config"},
                {template, "files/vm.args", "etc/vm.args"}]}.
{% endhighlight %}

and move it directly from your `reltool.config` to your
`relx.config` and it would work in exactly the same way. In Relx
you have more options though. Relx exposes more variables along
with the full power of a Django templating system (see
[erlydtl](http://code.google.com/p/erlydtl/)). You can look at the
documentation there for the full syntax supported. The variables
supported are listed below.
